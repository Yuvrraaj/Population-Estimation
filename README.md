# Satellite-Based Population Estimation using Deep Learning & Elevation Modeling

This project leverages **remote sensing**, **deep learning**, and **digital elevation data** to estimate population density from high-resolution satellite imagery. The system is designed to be interpretable, modular, and capable of working independently of traditional census data.

## Overview

The project involves:
- Preprocessing of satellite tiles to mask vegetation and water bodies using **VARI** and **NDWI** indices.
- Detection of residential and non-residential buildings using a **YOLOv8 segmentation model**.
- Estimation of building heights and number of floors using **DSM (Digital Surface Model)** and **DTM (Digital Terrain Model)** elevation data.
- Calculation of population estimates based on building area and vertical extent.
- A user-friendly **Tkinter-based GUI** for uploading inputs and visualizing results.

## Features

-  **Automated Masking**: Filters out vegetation and water areas before detection.
-  **Object Detection**: Segments buildings from cleaned satellite tiles using YOLOv8.
-  **Elevation-Aware Estimation**: Uses DSM‚ÄìDTM elevation difference to estimate number of floors.
-  **Population Calculation**: Applies rule-based logic on building size and height.
-  **Interactive GUI**: Desktop-based application for easy execution and visualization.
